# Frequency Modulation (FM) Data Visualisation.
## About The Data used
The data which is visualized in python using the matplot library is a data i obtained from the experiment i conducted in Telecommunication laboratory in my 400 Level at Electrical Engineering Department of Bayero University Kano, as a requisite for a course: Telecommunication Engineering 1 (ELE 4301). The Experiment title was "FREQUENCY MODULATION" carried out using TPS-3421 trainer. Frequency modulation (FM) is the process of varying the frequency of a carrier signal inaccordance with the intensity of the modulating signal or message signal while keeping the amplitude and phase constant. At different frequency from the generator serving as the carrier frequency(Fc), the corresponding voltage (Vi) which served as the message signal was measured using a multimeter and the result was tabulated as shown in the table below. although there were little errors which were approximated. we were able to later use a graph sheet to see the relationship between the carrier frequency and the message signal.

|Fc (hz) |Vi (volts) |
|---------|------------|
|1200 |0.5 | 
|1100 |1.0 |
|1000 |2.0 |
|900 |3.0 |
|800 |4.0 |
|700 |5.0 |
|600 |6.0 |
|500 |7.0 |
|400 |8.0 |
|300 |9.0 |

It is hence seen that unlike the earlier graph drawn on a graph sheet, this can equally be done using a python library called "matplot library" which increase accuracy and provide for better visualisation and analysis. hence my motivation for choosing the project.
## Conclusion
from the plot it can be seen that the frequency deviation is directly proportional to the modulating or message signal.
